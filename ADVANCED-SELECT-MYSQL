Q.1 Type Of triangle

SELECT CASE             
            WHEN A + B > C AND B + C > A AND A + C > B THEN
                CASE 
                    WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
                    WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
                    ELSE 'Scalene'
                END
            ELSE 'Not Triangle'
        END
FROM TRIANGLES;
// first checking the property of triangle and then evaluting type of triangle rule

Q.2 The PADS

SELECT CONCAT(NAME,'(',LEFT(OCCUPATION,1),')') AS N FROM OCCUPATIONS ORDER BY N;
SELECT CONCAT('There are total ',COUNT(OCCUPATION),' ',LCASE(OCCUPATION),'s.') FROM OCCUPATIONS GROUP BY OCCUPATION ORDER BY COUNT(OCCUPATION),LCASE(OCCUPATION);
// ';' semi colon allows sequential execution of statements
//CONCAT function function invoked to conact Strings.
// LEFT(OCCUPATION,1) to get first char from left of the coloumn value occupation
// multiple order clause are seperated by ',' comma.First Order by count,then if we have two same counts
// ordering by occupation

Q. New Companies
SELECT c.Company_Code, c.founder, count(Distinct e.Lead_Manager_Code), count(distinct e.Senior_Manager_Code),
count(distinct e.Manager_Code),count(distinct e.employee_Code) FROM Company c JOIN Employee e ON 
c.Company_Code = e.Company_Code GROUP BY c.Company_Code, c.Founder ORDER BY c.COMpany_Code;
